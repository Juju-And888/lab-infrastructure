# Services deployed on the cluster

In this folder, you can find the manifests and scripts that I used to deploy services on the kubernetes cluster I host.

As a simplification/short-cut, I also use the cluster to cover the reverse proxy function for services not hosted on the cluster. 
In that case, I'm using endpoints to connect to the said service.
